# RANSAC
The file "pr1.cpp" detects lines by RANSAC algorithm, draws them as lines of infinite length, clusters the lines by using K-means clustering algorithm and finally outputs the clustered set of detected lines 

The file "pr2.cpp" detects the points which voted for valid lines by RANSAC and then colors all those points. Hence all the finally colored points are a part of the detected line

Makefile is included for convenience
